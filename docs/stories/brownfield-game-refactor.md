# Story: Game Architecture Refactoring

<!-- Source: Brownfield codebase analysis -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to OKKA gaming platform -->

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want **each game to be separated into individual, well-organized files with clean architecture**,
so that **the codebase is maintainable, scalable, and follows KISS/YAGNI principles from CLAUDE.md**.

## Context Source

- Source Document: Existing codebase analysis + CLAUDE.md project constitution
- Enhancement Type: Major refactoring / architectural improvement
- Existing System Impact: Complete restructure of game management without breaking functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **New functionality works as specified**
   - [ ] Each game exists in its own dedicated file
   - [ ] All 30+ games maintain identical functionality
   - [ ] Game switching works seamlessly with new architecture
   - [ ] Clean imports/exports structure implemented

2. **Existing functionality continues to work unchanged**
   - [ ] All games playable without regression
   - [ ] Game switching via UI maintains current UX
   - [ ] Canvas rendering preserves existing behavior
   - [ ] Dark mode toggle works across all games

3. **Integration with existing system maintains current behavior**
   - [ ] React component structure remains compatible
   - [ ] GamePlayer component integrates cleanly with new architecture
   - [ ] App.js game definitions align with new file structure
   - [ ] No changes to user-facing functionality

4. **No regression in related areas**
   - [ ] Build process works with new file structure
   - [ ] Bundle size remains reasonable
   - [ ] Game loading performance unchanged or improved
   - [ ] Memory cleanup continues to work properly

5. **Architecture follows CLAUDE.md principles**
   - [ ] KISS principle: Simple, clear file organization
   - [ ] YAGNI principle: No over-engineering, just what's needed
   - [ ] Fighter pilot mode: Precise, efficient structure
   - [ ] No wasted code lines

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

**Current Problem:**
- Single 391KB+ GamePlayer.js file contains all 30+ game implementations
- All games mixed together in one massive file
- Poor maintainability and code organization
- Violates CLAUDE.md principles of clean, efficient code

**Current Architecture:**
- App.js: Game definitions and UI management (src/App.js:19-188)
- GamePlayer.js: Monolithic game implementations with switch statement (src/components/GamePlayer.js:19-103)
- Each game has init function (initTetris, initSnake, etc.) in single file

**Integration Points:**
- GamePlayer component receives gameId and calls appropriate init function
- Games use canvas context and cleanup via window.currentGameCleanup
- All games follow similar pattern: init function + game loop + cleanup

### Proposed Architecture

**Target Structure:**
```
src/
├── games/
│   ├── index.js (exports all games)
│   ├── arcade/
│   │   ├── tetris.js
│   │   ├── snake.js
│   │   ├── pong.js
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── action/
│   │   ├── spaceinvaders.js
│   │   ├── asteroids.js
│   │   └── ...
│   └── puzzle/
│       ├── casino.js
│       ├── blackjack.js
│       └── ...
├── components/
│   └── GamePlayer.js (simplified)
└── App.js (unchanged)
```

### Implementation Approach

**Game File Template:**
```javascript
// src/games/arcade/tetris.js
export const initTetris = (canvas, ctx) => {
  // Game implementation here
  // Return cleanup function
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code
  };
};
```

**Updated GamePlayer Integration:**
```javascript
// src/components/GamePlayer.js
import { gameInitializers } from '../games';

const gameInit = gameInitializers[gameId];
if (gameInit) {
  const cleanup = gameInit(canvas, ctx);
  window.currentGameCleanup = cleanup;
}
```

### Technical Constraints

**Must Maintain:**
- Exact same game functionality and behavior
- Canvas-based rendering approach
- Cleanup mechanism via window.currentGameCleanup
- React component integration pattern
- Game switching mechanism

**File Organization:**
- Group by category (arcade, action, puzzle) matching App.js categories
- One game per file
- Clear naming convention
- Central index.js for exports

### Safety Considerations

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Extract games incrementally, test each one
- Maintain original file as backup during transition
- Verify each game works before removing from original
- Use feature flag approach if needed

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

- **Primary Risk**: Breaking existing game functionality during extraction
- **Mitigation**: Incremental extraction with testing after each game
- **Verification**: Manual testing of each game before and after extraction

- **Secondary Risk**: Import/export issues causing games not to load
- **Mitigation**: Clear import structure and central index.js registry  
- **Verification**: Test import chain and game initialization

### Rollback Plan

- Keep original GamePlayer.js as GamePlayer.backup.js until completion
- Git commit after each successful game extraction
- Can revert individual games or entire refactor if needed
- Feature flag approach: new architecture can be toggled off

### Safety Checks

- [ ] All existing games tested before starting refactor
- [ ] Each extracted game verified individually  
- [ ] Integration testing after each major step
- [ ] Full manual testing before removing original code
- [ ] Build verification at each step

## Success Metrics

**File Organization:**
- GamePlayer.js reduced from 391KB+ to minimal size
- 30+ individual game files created
- Clear directory structure by category
- Clean import/export system

**Code Quality:**
- Follows CLAUDE.md principles (KISS, YAGNI, fighter pilot efficiency)
- Maintainable file structure
- Easy to add new games
- Clear separation of concerns

**Functionality:**
- Zero regression in game functionality  
- Same performance or better
- Clean codebase ready for future enhancements
- Easier debugging and maintenance

**Next Steps:**
1. Review story for technical accuracy
2. Verify file organization approach aligns with project goals  
3. Confirm incremental extraction approach is acceptable
4. Begin implementation with arcade games (lowest risk)
